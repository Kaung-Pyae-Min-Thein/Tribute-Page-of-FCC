        <h3>Some facts about Google</h3>
        <p>
          Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that
          specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include
          online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing,
          software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Five
          technology companies in the U.S. information technology industry,
          alongside Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft.

          Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin
          while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California.
          Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56
          percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock.
          They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on
          September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then reincorporated in
          Delaware on October 22, 2002.[12] An initial public offering (IPO)
          took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in
          Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015,
          Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a
          conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading
          subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's
          Internet interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google,
          replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.

          The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain
          of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core
          search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work
          and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides),
          email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud
          storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Duo,
          Hangouts, Chat, and Meet), language translation (Google Translate),
          mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, and Street
          View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts), video sharing (YouTube),
          blog publishing (Blogger), note-taking (Google Keep and Google
          Jamboard), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The
          company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system,
          the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating
          system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into
          hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics
          manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and it released
          multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel
          line of smartphones, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh
          wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset. Google
          has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber,
          Google Fi, and Google Station).[13] Google.com is the most visited
          website worldwide. Several other Google-owned websites also are on the
          list of most popular websites, including YouTube and Blogger.[14]
          Google was the most valuable brand in the world in 2017 (surpassed by
          Amazon),[15] but has received significant criticism involving issues
          such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and
          search neutrality.
